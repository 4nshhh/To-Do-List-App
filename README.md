# ✅ To-Do List App (CLI – Text File Version)

## 📄 Description
A simple command-line To-Do list manager built using Python. It allows users to add, view, mark, and delete tasks. All tasks are saved in a text file, so the list persists even after closing the program.

## 🌱 About This Project  
This is one of my first Python projects as a beginner.  
I built this CLI-based To-Do List App to practice working with file handling, lists, and user input in Python.  
It helped me improve my understanding of basic control flow, functions, and how to store data persistently using a text file.

- Python 3
- File handling (`.txt` file)
- Standard I/O and control flow

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone this repo or download the `.py` file.
3. Run the app:

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to read and write to a text file
- Managing lists and user input
- Structuring a simple CLI app
- Building persistent data storage without databases
